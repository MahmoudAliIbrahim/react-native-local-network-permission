Inspired from [navico-mobile/react-native-local-network-permission](https://github.com/navico-mobile/react-native-local-network-permission)

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-local-network-permission
```

## Push new version

Since we are not using any registry (like npm or github's), we push the `/lib` folder in the repo.
So do not forget to run `yarn prepare` and then push the new version to master.
